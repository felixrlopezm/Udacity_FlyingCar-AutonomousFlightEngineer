# Project 4: Building an Estimator for a Flight Controller in C++
## The Project
Here you can find my implementation of the fourth project of the [Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787).

This project aims at developing the estimation portion of the controller developed in Project 3, that runs a quadrotor in the C++ simulator.

In order to get an estimation of the state, the estimator exploits the measured data provided by the following sensors of the quadrotor :

+ **IMU**, whose accelerometers and gyros provide the linear accelerations in the world frame and the angular velocities (or body rates) in body frame of the quadrotor.
+ **GPS**, that provides the measured location and velocity of the quadrotor
+ **Magnetometer**, that provides the yaw angle of the quadrotor.

The estimator has the following building blocks:

+ **A Nonlinear Complementary Filter** for the estimation of roll and pitch angles
+ **An Extended Kalman Filter** for position, velocity and yaw estimation 
+ **And the provision of direct gyro measurements** for body rates

Next figure shows an overview of the whole estimator and the interactions (inputs, outputs) between its building blocks as well as with the controller, and the own vehicle (the quadrotor being controlled).

For more details about how the code is implemented, open the ``WRITEUP.md`` file.

The resulting code will interact with the controller of a quadrotor that flyes in a synthetic environment: the so-called C++ simulator. This simulator provides different fly scenarios.

The simulator and project scenarios were largely designed and built by [Fotokite's](https://fotokite.com) team and [Sergei Lupashin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dXEam9kVKk) in particular. The C++ simulator can be download from and installed according to its [Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP).


## Instructions for running the code in the C++ simulator

### Step 1: Clone this Repository
This repository contains the code of the C++ simulatoer as well as the code of the flight controller of the quadrotor.

### Step 2: Install an IDE and compiler
You need to install the necessary compiler and IDE for running the simulator. Depending on your preferences and OS you can opt for differente alternatives. Here I leave you some options (as the were given to my by Udacity team);

#### Windows
For Windows, the recommended IDE is Visual Studio. Here are the steps required for getting the project up and running using Visual Studio. 

1. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
2. Select Open *Project / Solution* and open ``<simulator>/Simulator.sln``
3. From the Project menu, select the Retarget solution option and select the Windows SDK that is installed on your computer (this should have been installed when installing Visual Studio or upon opening of the project).
4. To compile and run the project / simulator, simply click on the green play button at the top of the screen. When you run the simulator, you should see a single quadcopter, hovering (flying scenario 1).


#### Mac OS X
For Mac OS X, the recommended IDE is XCode, which you can get via the App Store.

1. Download and install XCode from the App Store if you don't already have it installed.
2. Open the project from the <simulator>/project directory.
3. After opening project, you need to set the working directory:
   
   Go to *(Project Name) | Edit Scheme*
   
   <img src="aux/Mac1.png" width="400"/>
   
   In new window, under Run/Debug on left side, under the Options tab, set Working Directory to ``$PROJECT_DIR`` and check â€˜use custom working directoryâ€™.
   
   <img src="aux/Mac2.png" width="400"/>

   Finally, compile and run the project. You should see a single quadcopter hovering (flying scenario 1).
   
#### Linux
For Linux, the recommended IDE is QtCreator.

1. Download and install QtCreator.
2. Open the ``.pro` file from the ``<simulator>/project` directory.
3. Compile and run the project (using the tab ``Build`` select the ``qmake`` option. You should see a single quadcopter hovering (flying scenario 1).

NOTE: You may need to install the GLUT libs using ``sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev`

### Step 3: Fly the quadrotor in the simulator
Once you have successfully installed the recommended IDE for your OS and have the simulator running, you can now fly the quadrotor in the different scenartios provided by the simulator.

In the simulator window itself, you can right click the window to select between a set of different scenarios that are designed to test the different parts of your controller. The estimator can be run and tested in scenarios from 06 to 11.

#### Keyboard / Mouse Controls
There are a handful of keyboard / mouse commands to help with the simulator itself, including applying external forces on your drone to see how your controllers reacts!

* Left drag - rotate
* X + left drag - pan
* Z + left drag - zoom
* arrow keys - apply external force
* C - clear all graphs
* R - reset simulation
* Space - pause simulation

When the simulation is running, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to impact forces on your drone to see how your controller reacts to outside forces being applied.

# Udacity Flying Cars and Autonomous Flight Vehicles

In this repository, I stored my implementations to the examples, micro projects and projects of the Udaciy Flying Cars and Autonomous Flight Vehicles Nanodegree program.

In general, I wrote my code using the starter code provided by Udacity as the take-off point and then I modified it or added my whole own code where necessary. I also included additional remarks and comments to those already provided by Udacity for easing the understanding of the resulting code.

I started the nanodegree in November 2022 and finished in May 2023.

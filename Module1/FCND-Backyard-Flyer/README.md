# Project 1: Backyard Flying Project

## The project

Here you can find my implementation for the first project of the [Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787), called BACKYARD FLIYER.

The project is about implementing a solution that makes a quadrotor to fly in a square shape autonomously. The programing language is Python and the code is written in Python. Autonomous control is done using an event-driven paradigm. That is, the flow of execution is determined by external events rather than a pre-defined sequence of steps.

The code is tested in Unity simulator. The code is similar to how the drone would be controlled from a ground station computer or an onboard flight computer. Since communication with the drone is done using MAVLink, you will be able to use your code to control an PX4 quadcopter autopilot with very little modification!

This how the drone flies: left, terminal screen; right, simulator screen

These are the fliying parameters during fly.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Simulator
Download the version of the simulator that's appropriate for your operating system [from this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

### Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
Set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda following instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

### Step 3: Clone this Repository

### Step 4: Open a terminal, inizialize the environment and run "MY-backyard_flyer.py"
